# Some Notes
- Written some several tests (Used vscode extension for jest)
- Didn't build a back-end for thius one so .env file should contain openweathermap API key

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the backend server.

### `npm run start-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
App is set to proxy requests to backend server (see `proxy` field in the `package.json`), so make sure that server is running as well (`npm start`).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
